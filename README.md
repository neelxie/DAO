# DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organisation
A DAO for holders of your CryptoDevs NFTs. From the ETH that was gained through the ICO, I built up a DAO Treasury.
The DAO now has a lot of ETH, but currently does nothing with it. 
To allow my NFT holders to create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an NFT marketplace,
and speculate on price.
Maybe in the future when you sell the NFT back, we can split the profits among all members of the DAO.
